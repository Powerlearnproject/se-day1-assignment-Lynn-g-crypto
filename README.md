Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the designing,developing and maintaining software systems in a structured way.
It helps in producing reliable,high quality and bug free applications.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The emergence of structured programming.It enhanceed readability and maintainability,encouraged modulariy and more organized codes.
The birth of object oriented programming.Enabled one interface to be used for different data types.
The agile revolution.It promoted faster delivery of functional software through short iterative cycles.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Planning which includes feasibilitybstudies and risk assessments to determine the viability of the project.
Requirements gathering and analysis which detailed documentation is created to serve as a reference throughout development.
Design where the system's design and architecture are created.
Coding where the actual code for the software is written based on designs made.
Testing.It is tested for defects and performance issues.
Deployment.software is deployed to a production environment where it is available for end users.
Maintainance and support.Where software enters  the phase after deployment and where any issues and updates are checked and addressed.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall methodology is a traditional and linear approach to software development while agile methodology is an  iterative,flexible and adaptive approach to software development.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
A software developer writes codes,design's systems,debuggs and troubleshoots,tests and validates codes andreviews codes.
A QA test plans,writes the test casesbfor manual or automated testing,performs manual or automated tests to identify bugs and performance issues,bug reporting and tracking.
A project manager plans for creating the project plans,facilitates communication between all stakeholders ensuring everyone comes to an understanding.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs provides a comprehensive facilitiesto computer programmers for software development for example visual studio,Pycharm,Eclipse.
VCS helps maintain a history of changes so developers can go back to previous versions if need be hence track the evolution of the codebase.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Debugging and troubleshooting complex codes spending a significant amount of time tryingto locate and fix the issue.IT can be overcome by using debugging tools,writing unit tests,code reviews and logging and monitoring.
Managing technical debt can also be a challenge whereby it can make future  updates and maintenance difficult leading to slow development cycles.It can be overcome by refactoring and code reviews and standards.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Functional testing which ensures that the software meets business and user requirements
#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the practice of designing and optimizing prompts to effectively communicate with AI  models to achieve desired outputs.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
The improved prompt is more effective because it is more specific,clear,defined scope and concise yet informative.
